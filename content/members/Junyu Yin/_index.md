say sth. here
Currently, I am embarking on my journey as a Ph.D. student in the [Computer Science Department](https://cs.gmu.edu/) at [George Mason University](https://www.gmu.edu/), advised by Professor [Keren Zhou](https://www.jokeren.tech/).

Previously, I received my master degree in Artificial Intelligence from [School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/scse) at [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/) in Jan 2023. Before that, I received my B.Sc. degree from [Computer Science and Technology Department](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/) at [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/) in June 2021.

If you have any questions or other information you'd like to share, I would be very happy to receive your email:
