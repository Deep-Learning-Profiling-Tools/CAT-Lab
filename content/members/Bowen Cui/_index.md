Hi! I'm a second-year CS Ph.D. student at George Mason University advised by **[Prof. Keren Zhou](https://www.jokeren.tech/)**.
My research focuses on **LLM benchmarking and evaluation**, **LLM-based code agents**, **LLM inference optimization**, and **LLMs for developers** (programming, code optimization).
Previously, I worked with **Prof. Juan Zhai** (University of Massachusetts) on trustworthy AI and with **Prof. Muriah Wheelock** (Washington University in St. Louis) on biomedical statistics. Before that, I worked with **Prof. Jionglong Su** (Xi'an Jiaotong Liverpool University) on reinforcement learning for trading strategies.
