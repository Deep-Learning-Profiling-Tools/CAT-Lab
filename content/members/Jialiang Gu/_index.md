Hi! I’m a CS PhD student at George Mason University advised by **Prof. Keren Zhou**.  
My research focuses on **ML systems & AI compilers** (e.g., Triton/NKI), **LLM-based code debugging/repair** for competitive programming (with a focus on **TLE**), **tile-semantics–first analysis tools**, and **discourse-aware summarization**.  
Previously, I worked with **Jialu Zhang (Waterloo)** on a systematic study of TLE errors and with **Muhao Chen (UC Davis)** on structural/news summarization. I’ve also been active in **ICPC/CCPC**, earning multiple **regional medals** and a **Hubei provincial championship**.
